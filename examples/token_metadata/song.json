    "description": "as the faerie queen slept\na soft fluttering outside her window \nroused her from her dreams.\n\nit was a ghost \none which had haunted her shadows\nsince she was a young faerie.\n\nhe was gentle & shy\nappearing as flash \nof blue & silver light.\n\nnot wanting to cause him to flee\nin formless fright \nshe kept her eyes closed & rolled over\nletting him gaze upon that \nwhich he, without a body, \ncould neither touch nor taste.\n\nback into her dreams she sunk \ndipping deeper into his blues\nmingling with his spirit form.\n\nalive inside her heart & soul \nthe ghost had found his home \nno longer cursed to roam.\n\n________________________________\n\naudio recorded by\nCarolynM8ri3 at home\non February 27, 2022\nat 20:09 HST\n\nself-portrait videography captured by\nCarolynM8ri3 at home\non January 18, 2022 \nat 17:39:26 HST",
